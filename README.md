## 🌱 Ocean (Forest) Briggs-Mineart  
**💻 Software Engineer | Web Developer | Problem Solver**  
**📍 Junction City, OR**

I'm a passionate software engineer with a love for building intuitive and innovative web applications. Currently expanding my skills in Flask and Docker through App Academy's bootcamp, I specialize in JavaScript, Python, and full-stack web development. I thrive on the satisfaction of solving complex problems and enjoy working on projects that push my technical limits.

### 🚀 Projects:  
- **[ApplySage](https://github.com/Forestbriggs/apply_sage):** A job application tracker for developers.
- **[Q-Understack](https://github.com/Sohna-AI/q-understack):** A Stack Overflow clone built with a 3-man team using React/Redux, Flask/SQLAlchemy, and Docker.
- **[Grand Line Gathering](https://github.com/Forestbriggs/Grand-line-gatherings):** My first full-stack project, built with React/Redux and Express/Sequelize.
