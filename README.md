## 🌱 Ocean (Forest) Briggs-Mineart  
**💻 Software Engineer | Web Developer | Problem Solver**

*Code, coffee, and the occasional debugging dance.*

I’m a software engineer who loves turning complex problems into elegant web applications with TypeScript and Python. Recently, I’ve been diving into Go, Docker, and AWS to broaden my toolkit and tackle new challenges. I aim to make tech both innovative and intuitive, and I approach every project with creativity and a drive for impact. When I’m not coding, I’m either attempting to master new guitar riffs or fueling up with a fresh cup of coffee—because every good project needs a solid soundtrack and caffeine boost.

### 🚀 Projects:  
- **[ApplySage](https://github.com/Forestbriggs/apply_sage):** A job application tracker for developers.
